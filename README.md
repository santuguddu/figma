# GPT-3 UI/UX Frontend Project
This project focuses on creating a modern UI/UX pixel-perfect frontend page, crafted from a Figma design that can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/lz9lLpFHMxHm2odnwM3R0z/gpt3?mode=dev).

## Technologies Used

- **React:** Utilizing functional components for modularity and reusability.
- **CSS:** Implementing fundamental CSS properties, mastering flex and grid layouts, and following the BEM model for maintainable styles.
- **Animation:** Incorporating soft and pleasant animations.
- **Responsive Design:** Implementing perfectly placed media queries for optimal responsiveness across various devices.

## Figma Design

The UI design is meticulously crafted in Figma, ensuring a pixel-perfect representation. The Figma design serves as the foundation for the frontend implementation.

## Project Structure

The React project follows a well-organized file and folder structure, promoting maintainability and scalability. Functional components are designed for reusability, making it easy to manage and extend the application.

## CSS Best Practices

CSS is organized following the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) model. This ensures a clean and modular structure, making it easier to understand and maintain the styling of the application.

## Animation and Responsive Design

The project incorporates animations for a smooth user experience. Media queries are strategically placed to ensure responsive design, catering to a wide range of devices and screen sizes.
